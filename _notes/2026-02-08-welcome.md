This is a sample note. You can add more notes by creating new markdown files in the `_notes` folder.

Each note should have frontmatter like this:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: Your Note Title
date: YYYY-MM-DD
description: A short description
tags: [tag1, tag2]
categories: [category]
---
```

Then write your content in markdown below the frontmatter.
